  <h1>Privacy Policy for Twitch Mention Notifier Extension</h1>

  <p>Last updated: December 28, 2024</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Twitch Mention Notifier extension is designed to notify users when they are mentioned in a Twitch chat. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use this extension, how we protect your privacy, and what data is collected, if any.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Twitch Mention Notifier extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information beyond what is required for its functionality. The only data collected is the information that you provide explicitly within the extension to enable notifications for your Twitch channel.</p>

  <h3>Data Collected</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Twitch Channel Information:</strong> The extension allows users to enter their Twitch channel details so that they can receive notifications when they are mentioned in a chat. This information is stored locally within the extension and is not shared with any third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What We Do Not Collect</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or login credentials for Twitch.</li>
    <li>We do not track your browsing activities or gather information from websites other than Twitch.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions Requested by the Extension</h2>
  <p>The Twitch Mention Notifier extension requests the following permissions in order to function properly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>"tabs":</strong> Required to manage and interact with the browser tabs to show notifications when a mention occurs in the Twitch chat.</li>
    <li><strong>"activeTab":</strong> Allows the extension to interact with the active tab, enabling it to detect mentions in the currently active Twitch channel tab.</li>
    <li><strong>"storage":</strong> Used to store your Twitch channel settings and preferences locally in your browser.</li>
    <li><strong>"notifications":</strong> Allows the extension to send you notifications when you are mentioned in the Twitch chat.</li>
    <li><strong>"alarms":</strong> Ensures periodic checks for new mentions in the Twitch chat.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are necessary to deliver the core functionality of the extension and to provide a seamless user experience.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data entered by the user (i.e., Twitch channel information) is stored locally in the browserâ€™s storage and is not shared or sent to external servers. This data is only accessible by the extension and will not be used for any other purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the data provided by users within the extension. However, as with any online service, there is no absolute guarantee of security, and we cannot be held responsible for any data breaches outside of our control.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Twitch Mention Notifier extension does not integrate with any third-party services that would have access to your personal information. The only external resource the extension interacts with is the Twitch API, which is used to check for mentions in Twitch chat, and no user-specific data is sent or stored outside of the extension itself.</p>

  <h2>7. User Control</h2>
  <p>As a user, you have full control over the information you provide to the extension. You can modify or remove the Twitch channel information at any time through the extension's settings. The extension does not require any other personal data, and no personal data is collected without your explicit input.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in how we collect and manage data. Any updates will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly. We encourage you to check this page periodically for the most current version.</p>
